							<h1 class="major">Python Analysis</h1>
							<p>The following visualizations are a result of a cleaning and merging process of different datasets, like:<br>
							- "athlete_events.csv": it has data about the athletes from 1896 to 2016.<br>
							- "olympics.csv": gives us a through insight over the countries' performance up to 2016.<br>
							- "tokyo_athletes": data related to the athletes who participated in the Tokyo Games.<br>
							- "tokyo_genders": categorizes genders for each discipline.<br>
							- "tokyo_medals": summarizes the count of medals per country</p>
							<p>And of course i went into detail later in an accompagning document that gives info about each dataset and its columns, but also about each DataFrame that was created later using the above mentioned.<br>
							These enabled me to portray a general insight of a few aspects of the games, such as:</p>
							<p>+ The next Bar Graph shows info about the 30 most successfull countries in the Olympics, ordered by the Total amount of medals won.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/6w8bJtr/Most-Medals-Won-By-The-30-Top-Countries.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>+ Same as before but here in this Bar Graph i included only the count for Arab countries.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/3s4C1GC/Most-Medals-Won-By-Arab-Countries.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>+ Here it shows the top popular sports that knew the highest rate of medals won, and again ordered by the total amount of medals registered per Sport.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/TczKNx1/Most-popular-Sports.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>+ This is another Bar Graph that shows the distibution of female and male medal count throught the years.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/mJD6TQN/Gender-Distribution-Over-The-Years.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>+ Next comes a Scatterplot which shows the participation of each gender per country.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bs14T4R/Gender-Distribution-by-Country.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>+ Same as before but this time i highlighted the difference of gender participation when it comes to Sports.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/k8110kv/Gender-Distribution-by-Discipline.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>+ For the rank of medals won by 20 most successful athletes i used a Horizontal Bar Graph.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/ZLgpjfB/Most-Medals-Won-by-Top-20-Athletes.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>+ Here we can see the ratio of medals won per number of participations.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/ZKnRLDk/Ratio-of-Medals-won-Among-the-Top-30-Athletes.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>+ In a Box Graph i plotted the distibution of height among male Basketball athletes throught the years.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Z8vSt6p/Evolution-of-Height-among-Basketball-Male-Players.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>+ And same goes for male Swimmers</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/DrWF6NP/Evolution-of-Height-among-Male-Swimmers.png" alt="" /></span>
							
							<p>+ This time i reverted to female Gymnasts.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/c8sjsj4/Evolution-of-Height-among-Female-Gymnasts.png" alt="" /></span>
							
							<p>+ And lastly for the height graphs, we have an insight of the difference between male and female athletes per year.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/PDD3Ygr/Evolution-of-Height-among-Athletes-in-Athletics.png" alt="" /></span>
							
							<p>+ Here i'm using a Pointplot to show the distribution of weight bewteen male and female weightlifting athletes.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/7Xy4902/Evolution-of-Weight-among-Weightlifting-Athletes.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>+ Same done but for the Gymnasts.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/m6y3gvV/Evolution-of-Weight-among-Gymnasts.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>+ Lastly i'm using a Line Plot to show the mean age of athletes in 5 popular sports.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/b5Pr3XK/Mean-Age-Distribution-of-Popular-Sports-1896-2016.png" alt="" /></span>
