								<h2>Olympic Games – Dictionary</h2>
									
								
								<br>
						
Welcome to my project, this is my attempt at a Data Analysis project, I chose this field specifically just because I love watching the Olympics with all its different, cool and weird sports. It really has a lot to offer in form of entertainment and also a LOT of data that we can manipulate to our gain and if possible learn from them and keep improving. <br>
<br>
I will touch on a few datasets here, that will allow me to get a broad idea on the visualizations I’m trying to reach. To be specific I will mention every column and what it gives, these datasets include:<br>
<br>
(Dataset) athletes_events.csv: this one has data on a massive number of athletes from 1896 to 2016, the columns that exist here are all related to each athlete’s info like: physique, country, medals. <br>
- ID: Number that is specific to each athlete <br>
- Name: Full name of the athlete, including their middle names and other additions<br>
- Sex: Female or Male<br>
- Age: Age at the time of competing in that year<br>
- Height: One uniform height measurement  <br>
- Weight: One uniform weight measurement  <br>
- Team: Country represented by the Athlete<br>
- NOC: Code of that Country<br>
- Games: Combination of the Year and Season in which that athlete played <br>
- Year: The year the athlete participated in <br>
- Season: Winter or Summer games<br>
- City: The city in which the games were held <br>
- Sport: The general name of the sport that the athlete participated in <br>
- Event: Distinct type of the sport <br>
- Medal: Type of Medal the athlete won, Gold, Silver, Bronze or NaN <br>
<br>
I stripped a lot of data from this dataset as I didn’t need the rows that had anything to do with the Winter games, I only kept the Summer data, and by that I had to drop the “Games” and “Season” columns because they gave me no additional info about the athlete or the event<br>
<br>
I named the Summer equivalent of this dataset ‘athlete\_events\_s’, the suffix ‘\_s’ refers to summer games and subsequently the ‘\_t’ refers to the total of both winter and summer.<br>
<br>

<br>
(Dataset) olympics.csv: this dataset has data about countries that participated in the Olympics. It includes info like the medals won, first appearance, …<br>
<br>
All the info about the columns are provided in the link below, But same as before I have to get rid of data about the winter game so I’ll drop of a few rows and columns: "Medal", "W\_Medal", "Apps", "Medal.1", "Gold", "Silver", "Bronze", 'WO\_Apps', 'WO\_Medal', 'WO\_Gold', 'WO\_Silver', 'WO\_Bronze'<br>

And just like the previous dataset I will be naming adding the ‘\_s’ suffix to the summer related data.<br>

<br>
`	`The next three datasets have info about the 2021 Tokyo Olympics<br>
<br>
(Dataset) tokyo\_athletes : <br>
- Name: Name of the Athlete <br>
- NOC:  Nationality of that athlete<br>
- Discipline: The event in which the athlete participated in<br>
<br>
(Dataset) tokyo\_genders :<br>
- Discipline: The events that help place <br>
- Female: Number of female athletes<br>
- Male: Number of male athletes<br>
- Total: Total of athletes that participated in the event<br>
<br>
(Dataset) tokyo\_medals : <br>
- Rank: Rank of the country by number of gold medals won<br>
- Team/NOC: Name of the country<br>
- Gold: Number of Gold won by each country <br>
- Silver: Number of Silver won by each country <br>
- Bronze: Number of Bronze won by each country <br>
- Total: Total number of medals won by each country<br>
- Rank by Total: Rank of the country by total number of medals won<br>
<br>
(Dataset) noc: This DataFrame will help me later in reorganizing and building new dataframes based on the country codes <br>
- Team/NOC: Country name <br>
- Code: Country Code<br>
<br>
<br>
<pre> ⚠ There will be some minor dataframes that I will not mention as they’re there as a bridge to help me reach another point of the build but won’t play a role in later visualizations ⚠ </pre>
<br>
The plus bullets below is used only to showcase the dataframes I’ll use to build visualizations<br>
<br>
+ First DataFrame: it’s called ‘updated’ and it sums up both info about the medals won in the ‘olympics\_s’ and ‘tokyo\_medals’, so we’re kinda updating the first df, the updated df will have the same columns as the first one but with more count of medals if the country has won any<br>
<br>
+ Second DataFrame: ‘arab\_olympics’ which is the same as before just filtered out the Arab countries<br>

+ Third DataFrame: ‘noc\_genders’ is a table that has info about the gender of athletes that participated in the Olympics for each country, its columns are:<br>

- Country: Name of the Country<br>
- Code: Code of that country<br>
- Male: Sum of male athletes who represented that country<br>
- Female: Sum of female athletes who represented that country<br>
- Total: Sum of all athletes<br>
<br>
+ Fourth & Fifth DataFrames: we have here two DFs ‘evnt\_genders’ and ‘all\_genders’, they both represent the same data and it’s the count of female and male athletes per Discipline, but the first has info just about the ‘athlete\_events\_s’ DF and the second merges data from ‘athlete\_events\_s’ and ‘tokyo\_medals’ so it kinda updates the count to 2021, their columns are: <br>

- Discipline: The Sport which those athletes played <br>
- Male: Sum of male athletes who played it<br>
- Female: Sum of female athletes who played it<br>
- Total: Sum of all athletes <br>
<br>
+ Sixth & Seventh DataFrames: ‘succ\_athletes’ which includes just the athletes that were successful in the Olympics by winning any kind of Medal, and it has the same columns as before, and then comes ‘succ\_ath’ that has info about each athlete and the number of medals won, its columns are:<br>

- Name: Name of the athlete<br>
- NOC: Code of the country the athlete represents<br>
- Apps: Number of times the athlete participated in the Olympics<br>
- Gold: Sum of gold medals won <br>
- Silver: Sum of silver medals won<br>
- Bronze: Sum of bronze medals won<br>
- Total: Sum of all Medals won <br>
- Ratio(T/A): Ratio of total medals won per participations <br>
- Sport: Specialty sport that the athlete won the medals in<br>
<br>
+ Eight DataFrame: ‘age\_event’ this one takes a few popular sports and gives us a sneak peak of the age difference between them all and through the years, this is done by calculating the mean age of the athletes by each sport. A few info about some sports were missing so I replaced them with the average. Its columns are:<br>
  - Year: Period in which the average was calculated<br>
  - Gymnastics <br>
  - Swimming<br>
  - Athletics<br>
  - Football<br>
  - Weightlifting<br>
  - Basketball<br>
  - Volleyball<br>
  - Water Sport <br>
  - Tennis<br>
  - Rugby<br>
  <br>
+ Ninth & Tenth DataFrames: ‘physique\_h’, ‘physique\_w’ both are snippets from the ‘succ\_ath’ but I kept the columns concerning the physique info of the athletes and then I dropped the rows that were missing Height or Weight info for each DF, the columns are the same except for the first I kept just Height and the second just Weight <br>
