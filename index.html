							<h1>My Portfolio</h1>
							<p>Welcome, my name is Abdelilah Imam. I entered the Data Science field to explore my passion in tech and programming, but mainly its uses in the real world.</p>
							<p>And there's no better way to do that than Data Science which includes: Coding, Analysis, Machine Learning ...</p>

									<h2>Olympic Games</h2>
									<p>This project goes over a few different aspects of the Olympic games. These games debuted in 1896 and have since became very popular among all types of people, athletes and viewers alike.</p>
									<p>My analysis includes two parts, the first is done in Python, in which i clean and visualize the data, and the second is a general visualization in form of a dashboard in Power BI</p>

							<h2>How It's Been Done</h2>
							<p>In this section i will insert every line of code i used to analyse, clean and prepare the data in order to reach the conclusion i did in the earlier sections.</p>
							<p>The projects' code will be included here and so is the code for multiple small projects that helped me learn how to navigate the data.</p>

									<h3>Olympic Games</h3>
									<p>This is my main project, in which i tried to combine different datasets that had important information about a few areas of the Olympics. As it is known 2021 was the year we enjoyed another event of the games, which were held in Tokyo, and as always we've seen a lot of happy, sad and awesome moments.<br>
									But unfortunatly i couldn't include other data that might help update the medal count for each athlete on some previous ones, and so the only thing updated is the medal count per each country.

									<h4>Others</h4>
									<p>In this section i will be going over a few datasets that i worked with before, these gave me an idea about how the cleaning is done by having data that isn't 100% organized and then comes the analysing part that's achieved by answering a few questions about the data.</p>
